1
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,495
Look at me. Look at me!

2
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,883
Do you remember me now, boy, eh?

3
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,377
Remember me? There's a bright boy.

4
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:23,142
You'll be coming with me, boy, and
you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

5
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,745
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

6
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,581
You're not a smart boy, is that
what you're trying to say?

7
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,542
Do you want to live, boy?!

8
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,464
North, boy, we're going north.

9
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,419
It told me to come with him, so I did.

10
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,673
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

11
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,634
Your father's not down there, little lord.

12
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,595
Not for many years yet.

13
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:47,226
- You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
- I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.

14
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,479
You've lived beyond the
Wall. What are you scared of?

15
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,524
I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.

16
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,116
That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard.

17
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,077
He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys.

18
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,998
That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

19
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,542
King Robert was supposed to marry her,

20
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,628
but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.

21
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,006
Robert started a war to win her back.

22
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,217
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

23
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,763
That's where I saw Father.

24
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,684
You see? He's not here.

25
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,403
Here, Shaggydog. Rickon!

26
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,699
That beast is supposed to
be chained in the kennels!

27
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,994
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

28
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,414
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see Father.

29
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,086
How many times have I told you? He's
in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.

30
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,588
He was down here. I saw him.

31
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,382
Saw him when?

32
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,677
Last night, when I was sleeping.

33
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,346
Here, Shaggydog.

34
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,562
You both miss him.

35
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:18,192
It's only natural he should be
in your thoughts and dreams,

36
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,236
but that doesn't mean that...

37
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,947
Bran...

38
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,550
- My lady.
- My lady.

39
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,927
My lady.

40
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,721
- My lady.
- My lady.

41
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,306
My lady.

42
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:42,443
Robb.

43
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,449
Robb!

44
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,705
You've ruined your sword.

45
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,510
Shh! Shh!

46
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,678
- Shh!
- I'll kill them all.

47
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,683
- Every one of them.
- Shh.

48
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,310
I will kill them all.

49
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,897
My boy.

50
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,485
They have your sisters.

51
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,614
We have to get the girls back.

52
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,327
And then we will kill them all.

53

Isn't it a funny song?

67
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,113
Thank you for your rendition.

68
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,782
I imagine it was even better
received at that tavern.

69
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,951
I'm so sorry, Your Grace.

70
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,162
I'll never sing it again, I swear.

71
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,497
Tell me, which do you favor -

72
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,459
your fingers or your tongue?

73
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,793
Your Grace?

74
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,462
Fingers or your tongue?

75
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,256
If you got to keep one, which would it be?

76
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,762
Or I could just cut your throat.

77
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,599
Every man needs hands, Your Grace.

78
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,434
Good.

79
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,229
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

80
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,272
I won't sing, Your Grace.

81
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,484
Ser Ilyn, who better than you
to carry out the sentence?

82
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,028
I beg you! Please, no.

83
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,448
No!

84
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,662
Your Grace, please. I beg
you, I will never sing again!

85
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,706
- I'm done for the day.
- No!

86
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,251
I'll leave the rest of the
matters to you, Mother.

87
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,922
Your Grace, please!

88
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,722
You look quite nice.

89
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,686
- Thank you, my lord.
- "Your Grace. " I'm King now.

90
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,981
Stop! No!

91
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,192
Walk with me. I want to show you something.

92
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,824
Do as you're bid, child.

93
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,709
...and as soon as you've had your
blood, I'll put a son in you.

94
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,877
Mother says that shouldn't be long.

95
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,134
No! Please, no!

96
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,969
This one's your father.

97
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,347
This one here.

98
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,726
Look at it and see what happens to traitors.

99
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,729
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

100
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,939
I gave him a clean death.

101
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,900
Look at him.

102
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,112
Please let me go home. I won't
do any treason, I swear...

103
00:10:55,238 --> 00:11:00,200
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here... and obey.

104
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,620
Look at him!

105
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,964
Well?

106
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,050
How long do I have to look?

107
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,055
As long as it pleases me.

108
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,225
Do you want to see the rest?

109
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,686
If it please Your Grace.

110
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,772
That's your Septa there.

111
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,527
I'll tell you what, I'm
going to give you a present.

112
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,281
After I raise my armies and
kill your traitor brother,

113
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,909
I'm going to give you his head as well.

114
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,495
Or maybe he'll give me yours.

115
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,420
My mother tells me a king
should never strike his lady.

116
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,090
Ser Meryn.

117
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,947
Here, girl.

118
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,536
Will you obey now?

119
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,414
Or do you need another lesson?

120
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,168
I'll look for you in court.

121
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,841
Save yourself some pain, girl.

122
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,801
Give him what he wants.

123
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,555
You'll be needing that again.

124
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,995
The proper course is clear -

125
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,791
pledge fealty to King Renly and move
south to join our forces with his.

126
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,044
Renly is not the king.

127
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,630
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.

128
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,507
He put your father to death.

129
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,509
That doesn't make Renly king.

130
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,304
He's Robert's youngest brother.

131
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:30,392
If Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before
me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.

132
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,519
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?

133
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,230
- Renly is not right!
- My lords.

134
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,233
- If we put ourselves behind Stannis...
- My lords!

135
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,528
Here is what I say to these two kings.

136
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,909
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,

137
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,411
nor Stannis neither.

138
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:54,333
Why should they rule over me and mine
from some flowery seat in the South?

139
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,295
What do they know of the
Wall or the Wolfswood?

140
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,381
Even their gods are wrong!

141
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,639
Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?

142
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,849
It was the dragons we bowed to...

143
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,936
and now the dragons are dead!

144
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:21,693
There sits the only king I
mean to bend my knee to -

145
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,946
the King in the North!

146
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,455
I'll have peace on those terms.

147
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,124
They can keep their Red Castle

148
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,044
and their iron chair too.

149
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,005
The King in the North!

150
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,969
Am I your brother, now and always?

151
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,554
Now and always.

152
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,184
My sword is yours...

153
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,313
in victory and defeat, from
this day until my last day.

154
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,149
The King in the North!

155
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,070
The King in the North! The King in the North!

156
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,155
The King in the North!

157
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,826
The King in the North! The King in the North!

158
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,494
The King in the North!

159
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,582
The King in the North! The King in the North!

160
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,542
The King in the North!

161
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,629
The King in the North! The King in the North!

162
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,381
The King in the North!

163
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,305
- Lady Stark.
- I want to see him.

164
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,974
Now!

165
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,413
Leave us.

166
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,713
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

167
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,548
Widowhood becomes you.

168
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,386
Your bed must be lonely.

169
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,305
Is that why you came?

170
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,060
I'm not at my best, but I
think I could be of service.

171
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,938
You slip out of that gown and
we'll see if I'm up to it.

172
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,404
Oh, I do like a violent woman.

173
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,408
I will kill you tonight, ser...

174
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,244
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

175
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,746
Let me show you how...

176
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,290
Hit me again, over the ear.

177
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:45,420
And again and again. You're stronger
than you look. It shouldn't take long.

178
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,132
That is what you want the world to believe,
isn't it? That you don't fear death.

179
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,468
But I don't, my lady.

180
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,763
The dark is coming for all
of us. Why cry about it?

181
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,475
Because you are going to the
deepest of the seven hells,

182
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,728
- if the gods are just.
- What gods are those?

183
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,899
The trees your husband prayed to?

184
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,194
Where were the trees when his
head was getting chopped off?

185
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,073
If your gods are real and if they are just...

186
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,325
why is the world so full of injustice?

187
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,621
Because of men like you.

188
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,125
There are no men like me.

189
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,252
Only me.

190
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,759
My son Bran.

191
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,304
How did he come to fall from that tower?

192
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,931
I pushed him out the window.

193
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,894
Why?

194
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,441
I... hoped the fall would kill him.

195
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,942
Why?

196
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,327
You should get some sleep.

197
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,663
It's going to be a long war.

198
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,982
I can't believe we're actually at war.

199
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,320
Was it this exciting last
time, when you were young?

200
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,159
What does it say?

201
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,829
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

202
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,207
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

203
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,376
Get back into bed.

204
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,345
They have my son.

205
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,267
The Stark boy appears to be
less green than we'd hoped.

206
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,646
I've heard his wolf killed a
dozen men and as many horses.

207
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,356
Is it true about Stannis and Renly?

208
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,150
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

209
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,736
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

210
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,655
It's a catastrophe.

211
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,658
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

212
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,872
There's your peace.

213
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,626
Joffrey saw to that when he
decided to remove Ned Stark's head.

214
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,921
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

215
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,049
than you will bringing Robb
Stark to the table now.

216
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,509
He's winning...

217
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:41,805
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- I'm told we still have his sisters.

218
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,266
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

219
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,602
No truces. We can't afford to look
weak. We should march on them at once.

220
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,980
First we must return to
Casterly Rock to raise...

221
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,482
They have my son!

222
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,195
Get out, all of you.

223
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,916
Not you.

224
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,642
You were right about Eddard Stark.

225
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:35,734
If he were alive, we could have used him to
broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,

226
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,281
which would have given us more time to
deal with Robert's brothers. But now...

227
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,284
Madness. Madness and stupidity.

228
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,332
I always thought you were a stunted fool.

229
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,169
Perhaps I was wrong.

230
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,921
Half wrong.

231
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,925
I'm new to strategy, but...

232
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:04,012
Unless we want to be surrounded by three
armies, it appears we can't stay here.

233
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,806
No one will stay here.

234
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,559
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders

235
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,730
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

236
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,858
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

237
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,279
And you will go to King's Landing.

238
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,741
- And do what?
- Rule.

239
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,037
You will serve as Hand
of the King in my stead.

240
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,374
You will bring that boy king to heel,
and his mother too, if needs be.

241
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,086
And if you get so much as a whiff
of treason from any of the rest -

242
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,214
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
- Heads, spikes, walls.

243
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,717
Why not my uncle?

244
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,011
Why not anyone? Why me?

245
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,472
You're my son.

246
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,232
Oh, one more thing.

247
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,610
You will not take that whore to court.

248
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,445
Do you understand?

249
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,717
Ser Jorah?

250
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,890
Gently, gently.

251
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,394
My son...

252
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,855
Where is he? I want him.

253
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,276
Where is he?

254
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,572
The boy did not live.

255
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,498
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

256
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,834
How did my son die?

257
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,422
He never lived, my princess.

258
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,007
The women say...

259
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,259
What do the women say?

260
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,850
- They say the child was...
- Monstrous, twisted.

261
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,852
I pulled him out myself.

262
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,981
He was scaled like a lizard,

263
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:24,319
blind, with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

264
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:27,489
When I touched him the
skin fell from his bones.

265
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:31,367
Inside... he was full of graveworms.

266
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:38,333
I warned you that only death can pay for life.

267
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,335
You knew the price.

268
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,338
Where is Khal Drogo?

269
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,507
Show him to me.

270
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:51,012
Show me what I bought with my son's life.

271
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,098
As you command, lady.

272
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,643
Come. I will take you to him.

273
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,562
- Time enough for that later...
- I want to see him now.

274
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,539
The khalasar is gone.

275
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,375
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.

276
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,128
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

277
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,131
I'm sorry, my Princess.

278
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,352
Drogo!

279
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,772
My sun and stars.

280
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,566
Why is he out here alone?

281
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,527
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.

282
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,575
He lives.

283
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,703
You asked for life, you paid for life.

284
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,998
This is not life. When will he be as he was?

285
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,168
When the sun rises in the
west, sets in the east.

286
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:08,214
When the seas go dry. When the
mountains blow in the wind like leaves.

287
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,064
Leave us.

288
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,776
I don't want you alone with this sorceress.

289
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:32,071
I have nothing more to fear from this woman.

290
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,158
Go.

291
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:44,250
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

292
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,961
It was wrong of them to burn my temple.

293
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,590
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work.

294
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,676
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

295
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,763
He would have been the
stallion who mounts the world.

296
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:01,059
Now he will burn no cities. Now his
khalasar will trample no nations into dust.

297
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,603
I spoke for you.

298
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,773
- I saved you.
- Saved me?

299
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,529
Three of those riders had already
raped me before you saved me, girl.

300
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,993
I saw my god's house burn,

301
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,623
there where I had healed men
and women beyond counting.

302
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,042
In the streets I saw piles of heads...

303
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,503
the head of the baker who makes my bread,

304
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:32,924
the head of a young boy that I had
cured of fever just three moons past.

305
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:38,221
So... tell me again exactly
what it was that you saved?

306
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,265
Your life.

307
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,811
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

308
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,524
Then you will see exactly
what life is worth...

309
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,318
when all the rest has gone.

310
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,666
You can't!

311
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,544
Get out of my way, Sam.

312
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,546
They'll put out the word.

313
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:15,216
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

314
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,177
Do you know what happens to deserters?

315
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,348
Better than you do.

316
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,976
What are you going to do?

317
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,020
I'm gonna find my brother

318
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,939
and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

319
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,527
You can't leave us now. We need you here.

320
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,364
- Move.
- I won't let you go.

321
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,200
- Move.
- No.

322
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,786
Hyah!

323
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,596
Hand of the King?

324
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,806
So it would seem.

325
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:08,311
And your father said you couldn't take
anyone with you to King's Landing?

326
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:11,064
No, he said I couldn't take
you with me to King's Landing.

327
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,984
- He was very specific on that point.
- He knew my name?

328
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:16,694
What?

329
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,405
He said, "Don't bring Shae
with you to King's Landing"?

330
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,367
I believe he used the word "whore".

331
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,495
Are you ashamed of me?

332
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,748
Are you afraid that I'm dancing
around the court with my tits out?

333
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,709
I'm funny now?

334
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,961
I'm Shae, the funny whore.

335
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,216
My father's probably the most
powerful man in the country.

336
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,801
Certainly the richest.

337
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,345
He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.

338
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:47,350
Everyone everywhere always has to
do exactly what my father says.

339
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,770
He's always been a cunt.

340
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,155
I believe the ladies of the
court could learn a great deal

341
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,990
from a girl like you.

342
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,330
Why don't you come with
me, be the Hand's lady?

343
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,043
Because the king needs a Hand and the Hand...

344
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,049
I know what a Hand needs.

345
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:34,897
Ghost?

346
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,107
Hyah!

347
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,568
Hyah! Hyah!

348
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,030
Hyah!

349
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,036
Samwell!

350
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,040
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

351
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,709
Did we get him?

352
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,669
Come on, help me get him up.

353
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:02,175
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

354
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,220
We're taking you back to where you belong.

355
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,890
- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

356
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,808
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

357
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,227
They'll kill you if they
know you came after me.

358
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,397
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

359
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,108
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

360
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,569
You took the oath. You can't leave.

361
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,696
- I have to.
- You can't.

362
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,157
- You said the words.
- I don't care about...

363
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,410
"Hear my words and bear witness to my vow..."

364
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:33,748
- To hell with all of you.
- "Night gathers and now my watch begins.

365
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,001
"It shall not end until my death.

366
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,086
"I shall live and die at my post."

367
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:40,880
"I am the sword in the darkness..."

368
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,798
"The watcher on the walls..."

369
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:45,551
"The shield that guards the realms of men.

370
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,305
"I pledge my life and
honor to the Night's Watch,

371
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:53,100
"for this night and all nights to come."

372
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:37,019
Do you remember our first
ride, my sun and stars?

373
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:45,736
If you are in there, if you
haven't gone away, show me.

374
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:53,160
You're a fighter. You've
always been a fighter.

375
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,622
I need you to fight now.

376
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,677
I know you're very far away,

377
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:14,599
but come back to me, my sun and stars.

378
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,290
When the sun...

379
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,917
rises in the west...

380
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,379
...and sets in the east...

381
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:52,053
...then you shall return
to me, my sun and stars.

382
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,955
Kings?

383
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,793
Oh, I can tell you all there
is to know about kings.

384
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,923
The thing you need to
understand about kings is...

385
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,640
For the past 67 years, I've known...

386
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:24,603
truly known... more kings than any man alive.

387
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:30,693
They're complicated men, but
I know how to serve them.

388
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,737
Yes.

389
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,281
And keep on serving them.

390
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,785
Aerys Targaryen.

391
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:46,208
Of all the thousand thousand
maladies the gods visit on us...

392
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,462
madness is the worst.

393
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,506
He was a good man.

394
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,634
Such a charmer.

395
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,388
To watch him melt away before my eyes...

396
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,810
consumed by dreams of fire and blood...

397
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,567
Robert Baratheon was an
entirely different animal -

398
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,403
powerful man, great warrior -

399
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:20,493
but alas, winning a kingdom
and ruling a kingdom

400
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,828
are rather different things.

401
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,455
They say that...

402
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:28,042
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

403
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:33,506
he can often be blind to
the enemies at his side.

404
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:38,177
Now I serve his son...

405
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,638
King Joffrey...

406
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,349
may the gods bless his reign.

407
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,687
He is a capable young man
- strong military mind.

408
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:50,856
Stern.

409
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,319
But sternness in defense
of the realm is no vice.

410
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:01,325
It's far too soon to know what
manner of king he will be, but...

411
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:07,498
I sense true greatness on
the horizon for our new king.

412
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,208
Mmm.

413
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,627
True greatness.

414
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,883
So what's the thing?

415
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,345
What thing?

416
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,222
About kings.

417
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:27,101
You said, "The thing you need
to understand about kings..."

418
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,103
What? Things? What?

419
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,314
When you started, you... Never mind.

420
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,860
Let me see you out, my dear.

421
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:38,946
- It's all right. No need.
- Yes, yes.

422
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,115
Till the next time.

423
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,220
Right.

424
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,875
When you imagine yourself
up there, how do you look?

425
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,252
Does the crown fit?

426
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,630
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,

427
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,716
the ones who sneered at you for years?

428
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:44,136
It's hard for them to simper
and bow without heads.

429
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,765
A man with great ambition and no morals -

430
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,476
I wouldn't bet against you.

431
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:56,523
And what would you do, my friend, if
you found yourself sitting up there?

432
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,027
I must be one of the few men in this
city who doesn't want to be King.

433
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,697
You must be one of the few men
in the city who isn't a man.

434
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,366
Oh, you can do better than that.

435
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,332
When they castrated you, did they
take the pillar with the stones?

436
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,250
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

437
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,587
Do you spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?

438
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:23,801
I picture... a gash. Like a
woman's. Is that about right?

439
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,762
I am flattered, of course,
to be pictured at all.

440
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,683
Must be strange for you, even
after all these years...

441
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,602
a man from another land,

442
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,021
despised by most,

443
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,356
feared by all...

444
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,066
Am I? That is good to know.

445
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:42,528
Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?

446
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,738
But you carry on...

447
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,909
whispering in one king's
ear and then the next.

448
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,955
I admire you.

449
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,291
And I admire you, Lord Baelish.

450
00:38:56,418 --> 00:39:00,879
A grasper from a minor House with a major
talent for befriending powerful men...

451
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:04,008
- and women.
- A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.

452
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,303
So...

453
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,472
here we stand...

454
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,100
in mutual admiration and respect.

455
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,185
Playing our roles.

456
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,645
Serving a new king.

457
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,106
Long may he reign.

458
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,316
- My king.
- My king.

459
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,779
My lords. Shall we begin?

460
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,699
You're Arry now, hear me?

461
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,784
Arry the orphan boy.

462
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,497
No one asks an orphan too many
questions, cos nobody gives three shits.

463
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,458
What's your name?

464
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:38,792
Arry.

465
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,463
You've a long way to
travel, and in bad company.

466
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,759
I've 20 this time - men and
boys all bound for the Wall.

467
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,179
Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,

468
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,515
and I didn't find no little
lordlings down there.

469
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,975
This lot -

470
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,979
half of them would turn you over to
the king quick as spit for a pardon.

471
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:03,150
And the other half would do the
same, except they'd rape you first.

472
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:07,780
So keep to yourself - and when you
piss, do it in the woods alone.

473
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,492
You stay with this lot, boy.

474
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,160
And stay...

475
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:16,955
or I'll lock you in the back
of the wagon with these three.

476
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,295
Watch yourself, midget.

477
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,048
He's got a sword, this one.

478
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,675
What's a gutter rat like
you doing with a sword?

479
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,762
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

480
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,430
He looks like a girl.

481
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,641
I bet he stole that sword.

482
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,143
Let's have a look.

483
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,648
I could use me a sword like that.

484
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,150
- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.

485
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,028
Look at him. You'd better
give Hot Pie the sword.

486
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,947
I've seen him kick a boy to death.

487
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,282
I knocked him down and I
kicked him in the balls

488
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,618
and I kept kicking him until he was dead.

489
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,537
I kicked him all to pieces.

490
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,208
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

491
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,960
I'll give it to you.

492
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,712
I already killed one fat boy.

493
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,257
I bet you never killed anyone.

494
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,093
I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.

495
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,053
I'm good at killing fat boys.

496
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,805
I like killing fat boys.

497
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,976
Like picking on the little ones, do you?

498
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,812
I've been hammering an
anvil these past 10 years.

499
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,314
When I hit that steel, it sings.

500
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,192
Are you gonna sing when I hit you?

501
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,034
This is castle-forged steel.

502
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,287
Where'd you steal it?

503
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,081
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

504
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,584
Where we're going, they
don't care what you've done.

505
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,045
They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen...

506
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,589
murderers.

507
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:52,050
- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.

508
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:57,181
But my master got sick of me, so... here I am.

509
00:41:57,307 --> 00:42:00,475
Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

510
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:03,812
It's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall!

511
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,398
And winter is coming!

512
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,181
Ham.

513
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:44,144
How many days in a row must a man be
expected to start his day with ham?

514
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,022
Bring me some beer at least.

515
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,068
You look exhausted.

516
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,195
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

517
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,784
Don't look so terrified.

518
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,536
If we beheaded everyone that
ran away for the night,

519
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,331
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

520
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,793
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

521
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,587
Honor made you leave,

522
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,381
honor brought you back.

523
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,384
My friends brought me back.

524
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,470
I didn't say it was your honor.

525
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:23,225
- They killed my father.
- And you're gonna bring him back to life?

526
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,519
No? Good.

527
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,313
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

528
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:34,111
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are
reporting whole villages abandoned.

529
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:37,281
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

530
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,533
from dusk until dawn.

531
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:44,121
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

532
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,791
to what ends the gods only know.

533
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,169
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men

534
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,547
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

535
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:57,759
Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them.

536
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:05,434
Do you think your brother's war
is more important than ours?

537
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:07,811
No.

538
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:11,732
When dead men and worse come
hunting for us in the night,

539
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:15,736
do you think it matters who
sits on the Iron Throne?

540
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,905
- No.
- Good.

541
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,658
Because I want you and your wolf with us

542
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,661
when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.

543
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,372
Beyond the Wall?

544
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,542
I'll not sit meekly by...
and wait for the snows.

545
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,545
I mean to find out what's happening.

546
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,590
The Night's Watch will ride in force

547
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:40,927
against the wildlings, the white
walkers and whatever else is out there.

548
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,266
And we will find Benjen Stark,

549
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,976
alive or dead.

550
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,104
I will command them myself.

551
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,816
So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

552
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:56,735
Move out!

553
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,446
...are you a brother of the Night's Watch

554
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:03,158
or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?

555
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,944
Is this your command, Khaleesi?

556
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,454
Drogo will have no use for
dragon eggs in the Night Lands.

557
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,668
Sell them. You can return to the free cities
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

558
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,837
They were not given to me to sell.

559
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,429
Khaleesi, my Queen...

560
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,057
I vow to serve you, obey you,

561
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,059
to die for you if need be...

562
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,438
but let him go, Khaleesi.

563
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,731
I know what you intend. Do not.

564
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,525
I must.

565
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,778
You don't understand...

566
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:25,824
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

567
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,701
I won't watch you burn.

568
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,371
Is that what you fear?

569
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,851
You will be my khalasar.

570
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:57,063
I see the faces of slaves.

571
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,566
I free you.

572
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:04,613
Take off your collars. Go if
you wish, no one will stop you.

573
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,281
But if you stay...

574
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:10,869
it will be as brothers and sisters,

575
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,288
as husbands and wives.

576
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,469
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

577
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:32,057
You swore to obey me.

578
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:44,027
I am Daenerys Stormborn...

579
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,947
of House Targaryen...

580
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,949
of the blood of old Valyria.

581
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,826
I am the Dragon's Daughter.

582
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:54,287
And I swear to you...

583
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:58,124
that those who would harm
you will die screaming.

584
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:00,919
- You will not hear me scream.
- I will.

585
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,757
But it is not your screams I want.

586
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,843
Only your life.

587
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,204
Blood of my blood.
