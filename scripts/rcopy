# Notes: disable owner+group because of Windows
# Note:  disable permissions when copying from NTFS (so you get user mask instead of 777)
#   pb: umask will remove write access to g+o, leaving execute to regular files. Best to chmodâ€¦
# -W (whole-files) can be passed too, useful for WSL bugs
# Adding -- after the options may prevent passing more options
# Compression: rsync compression is always beneficial
# SSH compression is good on many small files, slightly detrimental on few big mkvs
# So in case of backups, use -e 'ssh -C', otherwise don't bother
