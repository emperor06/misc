/**
 * ToggleArray:
 * An implementation of the LRArray found at p166 http://www.jjj.de/fxt/#fxtbook
 *
 * Here, down means false or 0 (and up means true or 1)
 *
 * This tracks the state (up or down) of toggle switches in an array.
 * The following operations are done in O(log n):
 * - switch a toggle up (or down)
 * - get the absolute index of the k-th up (or down) toggle
 * - for any given k-th up (or down) toggle, count how many toggles to its left
 *   (or right), including itself (or not), has the same state (up or down)
 *
 * This structure uses a BitField to hold the actual state of all switches.
 * This is basically an interface to an array of boolean.
 * Known (provided) implementations are:
 * BitFieldBoolean: uses Java's boolean[]
 * BitFieldSet: uses Java's BitSet
 * BitFieldDrax: custom implementation of a BitSet with no checks, easy to port to another language.
 * Performance: BitFieldDrax is the fastest, followed by BitFieldSet, then BitFieldBoolean.
 *
 * About the ToggleArray structure:
 * bsearch is a binary tree that is browsed using binary search.
 * Each node correspond to one index and holds the number of up switches to its left (including itself).
 * Here, "left" means in its subtree, not in the toggles array.
 *
 * Let's take an example with n=7 switches.
 * The first interval is [0, L] where L=n-1, with a middle point at L/2=3.
 * The interval (or subtree) to its left is [0, L/2[ and the one to its right is [L/2, L]. And so on.
 * The tree representation of the indices is:
 *
 *       3
 *      / \
 *    /     \
 *   1       5
 *  / \     / \
 * 0   2   4   6
 *
 * For the root node (3), bsearch[3] = # of up switches in [0, 3]
 * For 1, it's #up switches in [0, 1]
 * For 2, it's [2, 2]
 * For 0, it's [0, 0]
 * For 5, it's [4, 5]
 * So, in the case of node 3, we count all the up switches in its left subtree,
 *   1
 *  / \
 * 0   2
 * plus 3 itself.
 *
 * Now let's say toggles is [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
 * Replacing the nodes index with + (up) or - (down), we get the following tree:
 *       +
 *      / \
 *    /     \
 *   -       +
 *  / \     / \
 * -   +   +   -
 *
 * The root is up (+) and its left subtree contains another + (at index 2) so the total number of + is 2.
 * This means bsearch[3] = 2.
 * The node at index 1 (the root of the first left subtree) is a - and there's only one node to its left (index 0)
 * which is also a -, so there is nothing up to the left of index 1 -> bsearch[1] = 0.
 * Last example with node 5, it is a + and there's another + to its left for a total of 2 -> bsearch[5] = 2.
 * Now it's easy to fill bsearch and we get [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0]
 *
 * Important: ToggleArray has a special way of indexing/counting the up/down toggles.
 * Let's say the toggles are [0=down, 1=up, 2=down, 3=up]
 * getUpIndex(1) returns the index of the up toggle number 1. Counting always start at 0 so "up toggle #1"
 * means the second toggle that is up. Here, it's at index 3 (index 1 is where "up toggle #0" is).
 * That's what getUpIndex() returns.
 * Similarly, getDownIndex(0) is 0, getDownIndex(1) is 2, and getDownIndex(2) is undefined as there are
 * no "third down toggle". Only, getDownIndex() is not implemented here.
 * So here, we call 1=up the absolute index 1 (that's the index in the toggle array) or relative up-index 0
 * (because that's the first up toggle from the left).
 *
 * Another note because that structure may be a bit confusing at first:
 * numULI(5) returns the number of up switches to the left of 5 (included)
 * One may think that's what bsearch[5] is, but it's not.
 * bsearch[5] is the number of up switches to the left of 5 "in the subtree which root is 5".
 * So, to get the correct answer, numULI(5) should take bsearch[5] + bsearch[3]
 * bsearch[5] covers the indices in [4, 5] range, and bsearch[3] covers [0, 3] so the union is [0, 5] and the intersection is [].
 * These numXXX() functions are achieved using binary search. In fact, only numULE() is implemented, the other functions
 * just deduce the result from it.
