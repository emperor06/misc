/**
 * Trying to solve this endianness misery in C/C++
 * Apparently, C can declare structs with endianness awareness greatness
 * but C++ can't, because it can't. A patch has been submitted then removed.
 *
 * 2 things: the struct needs to be packed for me, because that's how fonts are
 * stored. And they need to be big-endian.
 *
 * Packing can be done with __attribute__ ((packed)) which is GCC-only.
 * Windows uses #pragma pack, which GCC now supports as well.
 * For a given struct, use #pragma pack(push, 1) before, then #pragma pack(pop)
 * after, so only this struct is packed.
 *
 * For the endianness, there's a global GCC parameter, which won't work on MSVC.
 * Or yet another __attribute__ thing.
 * Or a global #pragma scalar_storage_order big-endian which, hopefully, works
 * in MSVC too (it doesn't.)
 *
 * This code generates a warning about fread being given an "incompatible" type.
 * After checking https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/c/c-typeck.cc
 * line #7914, it appears that giving a endian-aware struct to a function triggers
 * a warning because that function may not be able to handle such structs.
 * This exception does not apply to "bultin functions" like memcpyâ€¦
 *
 * So this warning can be ignored with fread: just read the bytes,
 * write them into the struct's pointer, and let the struct endianness do its
 * magic.
